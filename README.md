# DevOps Basics  

This repository is a collection of scripts I created while learning the **basics of DevOps and Bash scripting**.  
Iâ€™ve documented my progress to keep track of my learning and to showcase how Iâ€™m building my fundamentals step by step.  

# What's Included?
Hereâ€™s what Iâ€™ve covered so far:
- **Variables** â€“ Understanding how to declare and use variables in Bash.  
- **If-Else Conditions** â€“ Writing scripts to make decisions dynamically.  
- **Loops** â€“ Practicing `for`, `while`, and `until` loops to automate repetitive tasks.  
- **Directory Check** â€“ A small utility to check if a directory exists or not.  

# Why I Created This Repo  
I wanted a single place to **store my scripts and track my consistency**, while also making it public so anyone (including recruiters) can see my learning journey.  
Each script here is something Iâ€™ve actually practiced and understood rather than just copy-pasting code.  

# Commit History  
I committed each script separately to simulate real-world version control practices:
- `variables.sh` â€“ 15 July 2025  
- `if_else.sh` â€“ 18 July 2025  
- `loops.sh` â€“ 25 July 2025  
- `directory-check.sh` â€“ 28 July 2025
